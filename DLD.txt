Step1: Start Algorithm
Step2: Declare variables x1,x2,y1,y2,dx,dy,m,b,
Step3: Enter values of x1,x2,y1,y2.
              The (x1,y1) are co-ordinates of a starting point of the line.
              The (x2,y2) are co-ordinates of a ending point of the line.
Step4: Calculate dx = x2- x1
Step5: Calculate dy = y2-y1
Step6: Calculate m = dy/dx
Step7: Calculate b = y1-m* x1
Step8: Set (x, y) equal to starting point, i.e., lowest point and xendequal to largest value of x.

 

              If dx < 0
                  then x = x2
              y = y2
                        xend= x1
        If dx > 0
              then x = x1
                  y = y1
                        xend= x2
Step9: Check whether the complete line has been drawn if x=xend, stop
Step10: Plot a point at current (x, y) coordinates
Step11: Increment value of x, i.e., x = x+1
Step12: Compute next value of y from equation y = mx + b
Step13: Go to Step9.
